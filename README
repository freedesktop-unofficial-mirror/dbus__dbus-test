Tests for D-Bus binding test rig:

Tests are functions which will perform a particular transformation on the input
and return the result. The should be defined as a D-Bus signature and
description of the function:

test-introspect.xml

Clients try and cause these to fail in the most obscure way possible. Servers
make sure all of their methods are called each run. Output format:

   Server:
      <interface.function> ok
      <interface.function> ok
      ....
      <interface.function> untested

   Client:
      <interface.function> pass
      <interface.function> pass
      ....
      <interface.function> fail <id1>
      <interface.function> fail <id2>
      report <id1>: <text description of failure>
      report <id2>: <text description of failure>


Starting clients and servers is done using Makefiles and chaining thereof. Each
binding should provide the following Makefile targets in their respective
top-level dirs:

   cross-test-compile - do any compilation necessary to run the server and client
   cross-test-server - run a server which binds to
                       org.freedesktop.DBus.Binding.TestServer. Listens and
                       answers method calls on the /Test object until Exit
                       is called. Then prints test reports.
   cross-test-client - run a client which runs comprehensive tests against 
                       the server, then calls Exit and prints test reports

Ignoring tests:

   Tests can be ignored if you know they are going to fail. This will print a
   list of ignored fails. To ignore tests create a file cross-test-ignore
   containing a list of interface.function, one per line.
